QA homework- pick a simple object and answer:
what is the best use you get out of it
how can you make it better
what is the pertinent most common defect you run into

See notes in bottom of QA slides

paper towel holder
holds paper towels
most common defect is i can't get a paper towel with one hand- either get the whole roll wet/dirty
I would add something to create more resistance to rotating the roll so that i can tear off a paper towel with one hand

going forward, what kind of testing do you think would be needed,
where do you start when you start to think of these kinds of improvements
how many different ways can you break it
